# Layout

> The very large number of devices today forces designers to follow some guidelines to design their layouts. By following it, we ensure to keep a visual consistency across multiple devices.

For more details, see our [Layout's guideline](https://www.decathlon.design/726f8c765/p/061870-layout/b/91b22f).

## Responsive Design

### Using [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

If you want to make your web application responsive, you can use media queries. Here are media queries that respects our guideline:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 599px) {
  /* Mobile */
}

@media screen, (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 895px) {
  /* Tablet */
}

@media screen, (min-width: 896px) and (max-width: 1199px) {
  /* Small desktop */
}

@media screen, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1799px) {
  /* Medium desktop */
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1800px) {
  /* Large desktop */
}
```

### Using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes

Every utility class in Tailwind CSS can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.

Here is the list of our breakpoints in Tailwind CSS Configuration:

<Source
  language="json"
  code={JSON.stringify(tailwindConfig.theme.screens, null, 2)}
/>

If you want to use our utility classes from Tailwind CSS for Responsive Design, [see this documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

With Vitamin, you will have to prefix Tailwind CSS utility classes with `vtmn-` and use our screens listed above.
For example, if you want to always have text align to left except for small desktops:

<Source
  language="html"
  code={'<div class="vtmn-text-left small-desktop:vtmn-text-center"'}
/>
